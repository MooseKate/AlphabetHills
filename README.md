# Prescribed Fire in the Nelchina Basin: A Case Study for Managing Moose Population.
## Abstract
The Nelchina Basin, located west of Glenallen, AK provides important moose (Alces alces) habitat throughout the year. However, previous research in this area has shown that the moose populations appear to be nutritionally limited by the available forage. The Nelchina Basin was deemed an intensive management unit to increase moose populations through predator control efforts and prescribed fires to increase the amount of available forage, including the 2004 Alphabet Hills fire. We quantified the available digestible energy (DE) and digestible protein (DP) during the summer of 2018 and 2019, as well as the winter in between, and availability of forages for moose within the burn perimeter and the adjacent unburned forest during the summer of 2019. We found that total canopy cover of the primary forage species was lower in the burned areas than in the adjacent unburned forest habitats. DP concentration was not significantly different between forested and burned sites, and DE and DP content varied across the summer and winter sampling season. We also found a significant difference in DE and DP across the two sampling years. Although others have shown a positive effect of wildfire for herbivore populations, we found that some areas, including the Alphabet Hills area, may not be suitably adapted to benefit from the quick release of nutrients after fire and may not allocate more resources to biomass as previously expected. This project highlights the importance of research that quantifies both the availability of and the quantity of available food resources for herbivores.

## Methods
Nutritional analyses were completed at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) Herbivore Nutrition Laboratory, in Palmer, AK. Digestible energy and digestible protein of all forage species were quantified using the methods outlined by Spalinger et al. (2010) and McArt et al (2006). 
Nitrogen concentrations were determined using a LECO TruSpec CHN and Cos-tech CHNOS Analyzer with NIST apple leaves used as quality control standard for every 10th sample (McArt et al. 2006). Digestible dry matter of each forage was determined from sequential fiber analysis using the ANKOM 200 fiber analysis system according to manufacturer’s recommended methods. Neutral detergent fiber (NDF) was determined with a neutral detergent solution made with sodium sulfite and an acid detergent solution was used to determine acid detergent fiber (ADF). NDF is an estimate of the ratio of insoluble fiber of the plant in the cell wall and the highly digestible cell contents while ADF is a measure of the cellulose + lignin/cutin concentration (Van Soest 1994, Spalinger et al. 2010). Samples were then extracted in 72% sulfuric acid to determine lignin + cutin concentration (Van Soest 1994, Spalinger et al. 2010). The sulfuric acid residue was then ashed at 500℃ for 3 hours to determine the mineral/silica concentration (Van Soest 1994, Spalinger et al. 2010, Cook et al. 2022). Because of a shift in sequential fiber values since 2012, we used a modified correction as described in Cook et al. (2022). Digestible dry matter (DDM) and energy (DE) were subsequently estimated from equations presented by Spalinger et al. (Spalinger et al. 2010).
Tannins were extracted in a 50% methanol solution under high pressure and temperature in a DionexTM Accelerated Solvent Extractor (ASE-200) (Close et al. 2003, McArt et al. 2006). The tannin extract was then diluted with 50% methanol, mixed with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and purified with Sephadex G-25. The resulting solution was mixed with Bradford Protein Reagent and read on a UV-Vis microplate spectrometer at 595 nm to estimate protein precipitating capacity (PPC, mg DSA precipitated/mg forage DM) (McArt et al. 2006). PPC was then used to calculate the digestible protein, the percent protein reduction, and digestible energy of each sample (Robbins et al. 1987, Spalinger et al. 2010).
